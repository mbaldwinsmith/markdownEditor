          <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
          <p class="legal-intro">
            Mark's Markdown Editor (the "Service") helps you compose Markdown documents locally and optionally sync them to
            your Google Drive. This Privacy Policy explains what information we access, how we handle it, and the choices you
            have.
          </p>
        </header>

        <section>
          <h2>Information We Access</h2>
          <p>
            We design the Service so that most of your work stays on your device. Depending on how you use the Service, we may
            access the following limited information:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Google Account profile data</strong> — When you sign in with Google, we receive your basic profile
              information (name, email address, and profile image) directly from Google to personalize the experience.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Google Drive file data</strong> — If you choose to open or save documents via Google Drive, we read and
              write the Markdown or plain text files you select.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Local application state</strong> — We store settings, cached file metadata, and offline drafts in your
              browser's local storage so the editor works even without a network connection.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Google Authentication &amp; Drive Access</h2>
          <p>
            The Service uses Google Identity Services to authenticate you and Google's Drive API to read and write the files you
            explicitly select. We request the minimum OAuth scopes required to list, open, and save Markdown files. We never
            access other Google data, nor do we store your Google credentials on our servers.
          </p>
          <p class="legal-callout">
            You can revoke the Service's Drive access at any time from your
            <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google account permissions</a>
            page.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
          <p>
            Information is used solely to deliver the features you request:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Authenticating you with Google and maintaining your session while you are signed in.</li>
            <li>Listing your Google Drive files and saving updates to the files you select.</li>
            <li>Remembering interface preferences, such as editor mode and recently used file names.</li>
            <li>Providing offline access to drafts until you choose to delete them.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We do not sell or rent your information and we do not use it for advertising.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Local Storage &amp; Offline Data</h2>
          <p>
            Drafts and configuration data stored locally remain on your device. You can clear this information by signing out,
            clearing your browser data, or using the "Reset" controls made available in the application settings.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Data Sharing &amp; Third Parties</h2>
          <p>
            We only share your information as necessary to provide the Service:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Google Identity Services and Google Drive APIs process your authentication and file requests.</li>
            <li>Service workers and browser APIs store limited data on your device for offline functionality.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We do not transfer your information to other third parties without your consent unless required by law.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Data Retention &amp; Security</h2>
          <p>
            We retain Google Drive access tokens only for the duration of your session and rely on Google's infrastructure for
            secure authentication. Locally cached drafts stay on your device until you remove them. We regularly review scopes
            and permissions to ensure we request only what is necessary for the editor to function.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Your Choices &amp; Rights</h2>
          <p>You can control your data in several ways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Use the editor offline without signing in to avoid sharing any Google information.</li>
            <li>Disconnect the Service from your Google account using Google's security settings.</li>
            <li>Delete local drafts and cached data through your browser or the application's reset controls.</li>
            <li>Contact us to request access to or deletion of any information stored on our systems.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
          <p>
            The Service is not intended for children under 13. If we learn that we have inadvertently accessed information from a
            child under 13, we will promptly revoke access and delete the data.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
          <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect new functionality or legal requirements. Material changes will be
            highlighted within the application and the "Effective date" above will be updated.
          </p>
        </section>
