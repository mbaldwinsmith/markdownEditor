          <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
          <p class="legal-intro">
            These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of Mark's Markdown Editor (the "Service"). By accessing or using the
            Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.
          </p>
        </header>

        <section>
          <h2>1. Eligibility &amp; Account Responsibilities</h2>
          <p>
            You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service. Some features require signing in with your Google account. You
            are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Google credentials and for all activity that occurs under
            your account when connected to the Service.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>2. Google Drive Integration</h2>
          <p>
            When you choose to connect your Google account, the Service requests the minimal Google Drive scopes required to list,
            open, create, and update Markdown or plain text files you select. You grant us permission to access only those files
            and metadata necessary to fulfill your explicit requests. You may revoke access at any time through your Google
            security settings.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are solely responsible for ensuring that you have the right to upload, edit, and distribute any content stored in
            Google Drive. We are not liable for loss of data arising from Google Drive outages or your decision to revoke access.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>3. Your Content &amp; License</h2>
          <p>
            You retain ownership of all content you create or import into the Service. By using the Google Drive integration you
            grant us a limited license to process your content for the sole purpose of providing the Service's editing and syncing
            capabilities. We do not claim ownership of your files and we do not publish them.
          </p>
        </section>

        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>5. Local Storage &amp; Offline Use</h2>
          <p>
            The Service stores drafts and settings in your browser to support offline editing. You are responsible for managing
            and backing up any local data. Clearing your browser storage may permanently remove drafts stored locally.

            We strive to keep the Service available, but it may be interrupted, suspended, or modified at any time without notice.
            We may update the Service to improve performance or address security concerns. Continued use after an update
            constitutes acceptance of the modified Service.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>7. Feedback</h2>
          <p>
            If you provide suggestions or feedback, you grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use that feedback to
            improve the Service without any obligation to you.

          <p>
            The Service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim
            all warranties, express or implied, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and
            non-infringement. We do not guarantee that the Service will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free.

          <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
          <p>
            To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or
            punitive damages, or for loss of profits, data, or goodwill arising from your use of the Service. Our total liability
            for any claim under these Terms is limited to the greater of twenty dollars (USD $20) or the amount you paid to use
            the Service in the 12 months preceding the claim (if any).

          <h2>11. Termination</h2>
          <p>
            You may stop using the Service at any time. We may suspend or terminate your access if we believe you have violated
            these Terms or if continued access poses a risk to the Service or other users. Upon termination, sections 3, 8, 9, and
            10 will continue to apply.
          </p>
        </section>

          <h2>12. Changes to These Terms</h2>
          <p>
            We may update these Terms occasionally. When we do, we will revise the "Effective date" above and, if the changes are
            material, provide notice within the Service. Continued use after the effective date of updated Terms constitutes your
            acceptance of the changes.
          </p>
        </section>

            These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Service's
            primary maintainers reside, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
